    <h3 class="mt">Question: Difference between map(), forEach(), filter(), find()</h3>
    <p><strong>map():</strong> method loop through the array do some operation on each element & return an array</p>
    <p><strong>forEach():</strong> method loop through the array do some operation on each element but don't return anything</p>
    <p><strong>filter():</strong> method loop through the array & find if an element matches some conditions & return an array</p>
    <p><strong>find():</strong> method loop through the array & find if an element matches some conditions then stop iteration and return the element</p>
    <h3 class="mt">Question: Difference between localStorage, sessionStorage & cookies</h3>
    <p><strong>localStorage:</strong> if we store data on localStorage it will not erase. </p>
    <p><strong>sessionStorage:</strong> if we store data on sessionStorage it will erase if we close the tab or browser</p>
    <p><strong>cookies:</strong> cookies usually store some data with an unique identifier or key to recognize user in the internet. There are two types of cookies 1.Magic cookies, 2.HTTP cookies. Magic cookies are an old and vulnerable according to security. Whereas HTTP cookies are more secure and updated</p>
    <h3 class="mt">Question: What is event loop</h3>
    <p><strong>event loop</strong> is the secret behind JavaScript asynchronous programming. It keeps an eye on stack and queue. stack executes in synchronous way and it's single threaded. whenever asynchronous behavior or method found, the call stack pass that asynchronous to web api for processing. After processing web api pass that to queue. <strong>event loop</strong> works between call stack & queue. When stack is free event loop pass the queued item to stack for execution</p>
    <h3 class="mt">Question: How quizTimer function is working?</h3>
    <p>quizTimer function is taking an parameter named dismiss. inside the function if dismiss is truthy then stop id(timer) & return. otherwise timer is executing per second and counting second, minute. if count value greater than 60 then counthtml element's text color is changing by the condition of count divisible by 2 or not.</p>
    <h3 class="mt">Question: How chooseQuiz function is working?</h3>
    <p><strong>chooseQuiz</strong> function is triggered when we choose any option from quiz. It takes two parameter, 1st is index of the quiz and 2nd is choosen answer. Inside the function we applying find() method to answers named array of objects and checking we already selected any option or not for that specific index of quiz. isExist is storing the return value of that find() method. If isExist falsy then push selected option and the whole object from quizData[index which we have got as a parameter] into answers array & call displayAnswers(answers). If isExist truthy then set serial value to 0. then loop answers array and check if answers element is equal to isExist if not then serial++. when if condition is true apply  answers.splice(start from serial value, cut one element, set new element) on answers then break from the loop & call displayAnswers().</p>
